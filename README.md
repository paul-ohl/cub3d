# Cub3d aka. Wolfenstein

A Wolfenstein remake (much simpler obviously) for 42 school.

The concept is to recreate the ray casting algorith of Wolfenstein to make the
player move in what looks like a 3d environnement.

This 3d environnement is created from a map file, that has to be parsed.

The project works with a library provided by 42 called minilibx.
